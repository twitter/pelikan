## Formula
Homebrew formula currently hosted at [homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/pelikan.rb)

## Install
To install Pelikan with Homebrew, simply run:
```sh
brew install pelikan
```

The above command installs and links all the binaries built in Pelikan, the
same files that you would find under `_bin` if compiling from source.
