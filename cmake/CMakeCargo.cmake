# Create a set of targets to invoke cargo and pass in
# the required linker flags. This is meant to be run
# in the same directory as the Cargo.toml file for the
# library.
#
# In all cases, the target can be used as if it was defined
# through the add_executable or add_binary. In addition,
# library dependencies will be properly passed through.
#
# Arguments:
#   NAME <lib-name>
#       The library package name as specified in Cargo.toml.
#       This argument is required.
#   TARGET_DIR <dir>
#       Overrides the default directory for the cargo target
#       directory which is ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/target.
#   BIN
#       Indicates that this crate generated a binary and to
#       expose that binary file as a target.
#   STATIC
#       Indicates this target generates a static library that
#       can be consumed by other cmake targets.
#   NO_TEST
#       Disables generation of the test target.
#
# Notes:
#   - If neither BIN or STATIC is defined then it is assumed
#     that the target exports no artifacts (i.e. it is only used
#     by other rust targets within the build)
#   - Build and exported are currently mutually exclusive. If you
#     want to have multiple targets like this then call cargo_build
#     multiple times.
#
# Additional Things:
#   - This also sets up the required cmake properties to delete the
#     target directory when `make clean` or equivalent is run.
#
# How it Works:
#   In general, cmake has a hard time integrating with external build
#   systems within the same directory. However, cmake has extensive
#   support for custom linkers and also allows you to define interface
#   libraries when no artifact is created. Together, we can use these
#   to trick cmake into thinking it is building the executable while
#   actually using cargo to build them. This means that things like
#   linker flags and dependencies should mostly "just work" (hopefully).
#
#   What we have to do depends on what type of library we are compiling:
#       - For pure rust libraries that don't export any C API, we define
#         an interface library. This means that any linker flags are
#         properly passed on to downstream dependencies. In addition, we
#         define a custom target so the library is built.
#       - For static libraries, we define a library that's built using a
#         custom linker language. The custom linker command is really just
#         a `cargo build` in disguise, but one that passes the correct
#         flags in.
#       - For binaries, we define an executable target also using a custom
#         linker language similar to a static library.
#
#   To pass the proper linker flags to the rust process, we have a special
#   target <NAME>.linkflags.txt that echoes the linker flags into a known
#   file. These are then picked up by the import-link-flags crate which
#   uses a build script to pass them to rustc.

    # The following is a hack. It takes advantage of the fact that

    # to invoke cargo as our linker command. To do this, we define
    # a custom language specific to only our target that also takes
    # in the required environment variables we want to set and the
    # output file generated by cargo.
    #
    # This works by running a cmake script during build-time which
    # parses the link flags and sends them off to cargo as -Clink-flag=...
    # For the full details in what's done during build see CargoLink.cmake.
    #
    # The upside of this hack is that it allows libraries and binaries
    # generated by cargo to be used as normal cmake targets. This
    # means that stuff like target_link_libraries works properly.

    # Extra Note: The variables that look like <VAR_NAME> in the string
    #   below are called expansion variables by the community wiki. They
    #   don't seem to be documented anywhere in the official docs but
    #   are hopefully stable.
    #
    # Another Note: Since these are required to be global variables we
    #   push them in the cache as hidden variables.
    #
    # Note 3: There is a <FLAGS> expansion rule in the docs which I would
    #         expect to expand to what was passed in to target_compile_flags.
