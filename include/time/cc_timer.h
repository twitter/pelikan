struct duration;  /* data structure to measure duration */

/* we declare duration and timeout in the header so static allocation is
 * possible. This is less than ideal from a clean abstraction point of view,
 * and the reason that a compromise is made for performance/efficiency reasons.
 * Mostly we want data structures related to time to be light-weight, so they
 * can be used whenever applicable, and the only way to avoid calling malloc
 * or equivalent, i.e. allocating on the stack, is to have static types.
 *
 * Users should NOT access these members directly.
 *
 * For duration: we use different declarations to stay in line with system APIs
 *
 * For timeouts: using uint64_t to represent the timeout timestamp seems
 * straightforward with most OSes. It is going to be slightly trickier with
 * Windows, which we currently don't support.
 * Reference: http://nadeausoftware.com/articles/2012/04/c_c_tip_how_measure_elapsed_real_time_benchmarking
 *
 * different implementations may interpret the tp (timestamp) field differently:
 * - on most POSIX-like platforms it means nanoseconds since an unspecified point;
 * - on OS X it means `mach time units' since an unspecified point, the
 *   relationship between this unit and nanosecond can be obtained via another
 *   syscall

 *   the denominator to calculate average value or rate, and hence shouldn't be
 *   rounded off prematurely, especially when user prefers a coarser unit such
 *   as second;
 * - timeout is used to catch outliers (requests that have failed) or scheduled
 *   activities (aggregation, flush file, log rotate). It is thus subject to the
 *   time granularity of system scheduler, which is quite coarse compared to a
 *   nanosecond. So it is more important to return a type that is easy for logic
 *   operation (e.g. compare), while the precision of the return value is not
