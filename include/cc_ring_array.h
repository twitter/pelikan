 * This ring array is designed specifically with communication between two
 * threads in mind, with one thread as the producer and the other thread as the
 * consumer. In other words, one thread does all of the pushing and the other
 * thread does all of the popping. Given these conditions are met, the ring
 * array can guarantee that all pushes and pops will be valid and leave the
 * array in a valid state.
