# Pelikan

Pelikan is Twitter's framework for developing cache services. It is:

* **Fast**: Pelikan provides high-throughput and low-latency caching solutions.

* **Reliable**: Pelikan is designed for large-scale deployment and the
  implementation is informed by our operational experiences.

* **Modular**: Pelikan is a framework for rapidly developing new caching
  solutions by focusing on the inherent architectural similarity between caching
  services and providing reusable low-level components.

# Overview
After years of using and working on various cache services, we built a common
framework that reveals the inherent architectural similarity among them.

By creating well-defined modules, most of the low-level functionalities are
reused as we create different binaries. The implementation learns from our
operational experiences to improve performance and reliability, and leads to
software designed for large-scale deployment.

The framework approach allows us to develop new features and protocols quickly.

## Products
Pelikan contains the following products:
- `pelikan_segcache_rs`: a Memcached-like server with extremely high memory
  efficiency and excellent core scalability. See our [NSDI'21 paper] for design
  and evaluation details.
- `pelikan_pingserver_rs`: an over-engineered, production-ready ping server
  useful as a tutorial and for measuring baseline RPC performance
- [`momento_proxy`][momento_proxy-url]: a proxy which allows existing 
  applications to use Momento instead of a Memcache-compatible cache backend.

## Legacy
Pelikan legacy codebase can be found within the `legacy` folder of this project.
It is composed of the original C codebase and backend implementations. It
remains as a reference, but is not recommended for production deployments.

## Features
- runtime separation of control and data plane
- predictably low latencies via lockless data structures, worker never blocks
- per-module config options and metrics that can be composed easily
- multiple storage and protocol implementations, easy to further extend
- low-overhead command logger for hotkey and other important data analysis

# Building Pelikan

## Requirement
- Rust [stable toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- C toolchain: `llvm/clang (>= 7.0)`
- Build tools: `cmake (>= 3.2)`

## Build
```sh
git clone https://github.com/twitter/pelikan.git
cd pelikan
cargo build --release
```

## Tests
```sh
cargo test
```

# Usage
Using `pelikan_segcache_rs` as an example, other executables are highly similar.

To get info of the service, including usage format and options, run:
```sh
target/release/pelikan_segcache_rs --help
```

To launch the service with default settings, simply run:
```sh
target/release/pelikan_segcache_rs
```

To launch the service with the sample config file, run:
```sh
target/release/pelikan_segcache_rs config/segcache.toml
```

You should be able to try out the server using an existing memcached client,
or simply with `telnet`.
```sh
$ telnet localhost 12321
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
set foo 0 0 3
bar
STORED
```

**Attention**: use `admin` port for all non-data commands.
```sh
$ telnet localhost 9999
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

## Configuration

Pelikan is file-first when it comes to configurations, and currently is
config-file only. You can create a new config file following the examples
included under the `config` directory.
