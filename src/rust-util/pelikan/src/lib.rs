//! Pelikan is a collection of modules that can be used to
//! build high-performance low-latency servers.
//!
//! This library is an in-progress wrapper of all the main
//! pelikan modules. In the future it may be split apart
//! into a separate crate for each module instead of
//! monolithic `pelikan-sys` and `pelikan` crates.
//!
//! # General Layout
//! The [`core`](crate::core) module contains the event loop
//! and server connection parts of pelikan. Every pelikan-based
//! server will need to use core as the part of the server.
//!
