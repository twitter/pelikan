//! HTTP protocol for pelikan.
//!
//! This crate contains definitions for a basic REST protocol for interacting
//! with a cache. It supports just 3 operations:
//! - `GET` - get the value associated with the provided key, if present
//! - `PUT` - set the value associated with the provided key
//! - `DELETE` - remove a key from the cache
//!
//! In all cases the key is passed in as the request path in the request
//! and the value is passed in as the request body. The protocol supports
//! reusing the HTTP connection for multiple requests. The only length
//! specification supported by pelikan is setting the Content-Length header.
