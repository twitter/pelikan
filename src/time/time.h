/* TODO(yao): move this into ccommon:
 *   It is common to have a TTL/age for keys in key-value store. A wrapper
 *   like this often achieves two goals: 1) it provides a process-local, cached
 *   time value so we don't need to call the relatively expensive time syscalls
 *   too often; 2) since we are already using a local timer, the zero point of
 *   the timer can be set for the process to simplify operations like timestamp
 *   comparison, expiration, etc.
 *
 *   The existing caching solutions have timestamps of vaiours granularity and
 *   definition: e.g. Redis has high resolution TTL, while memcached time is at
 *   second-level granularity. To remain protocol compatible with these imple-
 *   mentations, we may need more than one time wrapper. And even more may be
 *   added in the future to strike different balance between precision and cost.

/*
 * How time works internally for memcached
 *
 * Memcached server uses a timer with second granularity, which starts as the
 * process starts, and is set to 2 initially to avoid having 0 aged items.
 *
 * On systems where size(time_t) > sizeof(uint32_t), this gives
 * us space savings over tracking absolute unix time of type time_t

 * From memcache protocol specification:
 *
 * Some commands involve a client sending some kind of expiration time
 * (relative to an item or to an operation requested by the client) to
 * the server. In all such cases, the actual value sent may either be
 * Unix time (number of seconds since January 1, 1970, as a 32-bit
 * value), or a number of seconds starting from current time. In the
 * latter case, this number of seconds may not exceed 60*60*24*30 (number
 * of seconds in 30 days); if the number sent by a client is larger than
 * that, the server will consider it to be real Unix time value rather
 * than an offset from current time.

 * of requests a second.
 *
 * Also keeping track of time as relative to server-start timestamp
 * instead of absolute unix timestamps gives us a space savings on
