# Pelikan

Pelikan is Twitter's framework for developing cache services. It is:

* **Fast**: Pelikan provides high-throughput and low-latency caching solutions.

* **Reliable**: Pelikan is designed for large-scale deployment and the
  implementation is informed by our operational experiences.

* **Modular**: Pelikan is a framework for rapidly developing new caching
  solutions by focusing on the inherent architectural similarity between caching
  services and providing reusable low-level components.

# Overview
After years of using and working on various cache services, we built a common
framework that reveals the inherent architectural similarity among them.

By creating well-defined modules, most of the low-level functionalities are
reused as we create different binaries. The implementation learns from our
operational experiences to improve performance and reliability, and leads to
software designed for large-scale deployment.

The framework approach allows us to develop new features and protocols quickly.

## Products
Currently Pelikan yields the following products:
- `pelikan_twemcache`: a Twemcache replacement
- `pelikan_slimcache`: a Memcached-like server with ultra-low memory overhead-
  compared to Memcached/Redis, the per-key overhead is reduced by up to 90%
- `pelikan_pingserver`: an over-engineered, production-ready ping server useful
  as a tutorial and for measuring baseline RPC performance
- **[Experimental]**`pelikan_segcache`: a Memcached-like server with extremely high
  memory efficiency and excellent core scalability. See our [NSDI'21 paper]
  for design and evaluation details.

## Features
- runtime separation of control and data plane
- predictably low latencies via lockless data structures, worker never blocks
- per-module config options and metrics that can be composed easily
- multiple storage and protocol implementations, easy to further extend
- low-overhead command logger for hotkey and other important data analysis

# Building Pelikan

## Requirement
- platform: Mac OS X or Linux
- build tools: `cmake (>=2.8)`
- compiler: `gcc (>=4.8)` or `clang (>=3.1)`
- (optional) unit testing framework: `check (>=0.10.0)`. See below.

## Build
```sh
git clone https://github.com/twitter/pelikan.git
cd pelikan
mkdir _build && cd _build
cmake ..
make -j
```
The executables can be found under ``_bin/`` (under build directory)

To run all the tests, including those on `ccommon`, run:
```sh
make test
```

To skip building tests, replace the `cmake` step with the following:
```sh
cmake -DCHECK_WORKING=off ..
```
## Install `check`
To compile and run tests, you will have to install `[check]`. Please follow
instructions in the project.

**Note**: we highly recommend installing the latest version of `check` from
source, as there are, unfortunately, a [linker bug][check-linker-bug] in
packages installed by the current versions of `brew` (OS X), `CentOS` and
`Ubuntu LTS`. The bug does not affect building executables.


# Usage
Using `pelikan_twemcache` as an example, other executables are highly similar.

To get info of the service, including usage format and options, run:
```sh
_bin/pelikan_twemcache -h
```

To launch the service with default settings, simply run:
```sh
_bin/pelikan_twemcache
```

To launch the service with the sample config file, run:
```sh
_bin/pelikan_twemcache config/twemcache.conf
```

You should be able to try out the server using an existing memcached client,
or simply with `telnet`.
```sh
$ telnet localhost 12321
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
set foo 0 0 3
bar
STORED
```

**Attention**: use `admin` port for all non-data commands.
```sh
$ telnet localhost 9999
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
version

stats
STAT pid 54937
STAT time 1459634909
STAT uptime 22
STAT version 100
STAT ru_stime 0.019172
...
```

## Configuration

Pelikan is file-first when it comes to configurations, and currently is
config-file only. You can create a new config file following the examples
included under the `config` directory.

**Tip**: to get a list of config options for each executable, use `-c` option:
```sh
_bin/pelikan_twemcache -c
```
