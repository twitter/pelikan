 * This is intended to be used in conjunction with the storage modules in
 * Pelikan, such as slab-based or cuckoo hashing based storage. Therefore,
 * we are making some notably different assumptions:
 *   - no memory allocation or freeing is attempted within this module
 *   - # of entries (nentry) is a 32-bit field, instead of 16, the 2 extra bytes
 *     allows us to guarantee O(1) runtime to get the cardinality of any ziplist
 *   - APIs are updated to reflect the changes above and Pelikan's style guide
 *   - no support for big-endian machines for the moment
 *   - unsigned integer only (also, redis' implementation is confusing to me)
 *   - optimize encoding for small integers not for small strings
 *   - do not allow anything longer than 252 byte to be stored as ziplist, in
 *       the future, such support can be added by using pointers to link to
 *       other items, something that worked in our earlier prototype.

/* The ziplist is a specially encoded dually linked list that is designed
 * to be very memory efficient. It stores both strings and integer values.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * ZIPLIST OVERALL LAYOUT
 * ======================
 *
 * The general layout of the ziplist is as follows:
 *
 * <nentry> <zlend> <entry> <entry> ... <entry>
 * ╰--------------╯ ╰-------------------------╯
 *       header                 body
 *
 * Overhead: 8 bytes
 *
 * <uint32_t nentry> is the number of entries.
 *
 * <uint32_t zlend> is the offset to end of the last entry in the list. This
 * allows a pop operation on the far side of the list without the need for full
 * traversal. Note 0 starts from the beginning of the header, and the smallest
 * entry is 2 bytes, so zlend less than 9 indicate an empty list.
 *
 *
 * ZIPLIST ENTRIES
 * ===============
 *
 * Every entry in the ziplist contains the encoding, which indicates type and
 * length, value of the entry, followed by length of the entry as at the end.
 * When scanning forward, the encoding provides the length of the entry, while
 * the same information can be obtained by reading the last byte of the entry
 * if traversing backward.
 *
 * A complete entry is stored like this:
 *
 * <encoding> <data> <len>
 *
 * Sometimes the encoding represents the entry itself, like for small integers
 * as we'll see later. In such a case the <entry-data> part is missing, and we
 * could have just:
 *
 * <encoding/data> <len>
 *
 * len takes exactly 1 byte, as we only cater to smaller entries for now.
 *
 * The encoding and value of the entry are content-dependent.
 * <= 250 : 1 byte, no memory overhead
 *      unsigned integer up to 250
 * == 251 : 3 (1+2) bytes, 50.0% overhead
 *      unsigned integer up to (2^16 - 1)
 * == 252 : 4 (1+3) bytes, 33.3% overhead
 *      unsigned integer up to (2^24 - 1)
 * == 253 : 8 (1+7) bytes, 14.3% overhead
 *      unsigned integer up to (2^56 - 1)
 * == 254 : 9 (1+8) bytes, 12.5% overhead
 *      unsigned integer up to (2^64 - 1)
 * == 255 : (1 + 1 + N) bytes, upto 200% overhead for 1-byte strings, but that
*           can be stored as integer to avoid this overhead
 *      string up to 252 bytes (yields a 255 byte zipentry)
 *
 * This encoding is different from ziplist in Redis, which optimizes for small
 * strings (1 byte overhead instead of 2) instead of small integers. We do it
 * differently because in practice it seems values small in size tend to be
 * numerical in nature, so we decide to optimize for storing small integers
 * efficiently instead.
 * We also don't attempt to embed large values as ziplist entries, because the
 * operations on large values generally have very different considerations from
 * small ones. For example, it is much more important to make sure memory
 * operations are efficient (such as resizing and copying) when updating large
 * values, and the overhead of encoding becomes negligible. They also will have
 * very different runtime characteristics. So instead of supporting all value
 * sizes in theory and running into operational issues later, it is better,
 * at least operationally, to make such limitations explicit and deal with
 * different use cases separately.
 *
 * RUNTIME
 * =======
 * All lookups generally gets more expensive as the number of entries increases,
 * roughly linearly (not considering various cache size cutoffs). For the same
 * list, looking up entries at the beginning are generally cheaper than entries
 * in the middle; for index-based lookup, both ends are cheaper than somewhere
 * in the middle, but for value-based lookup (where a match is performed), it
 * is more expensive if a match is found toward the end.
 *
 * Insertion and removal of entries involve index-based lookup, as well as
 * shifting data. So in additional to the considerations above, the amount of
 * data being moved for updates will affect performance. Updates near the "fixed
 * end" of the ziplist (currently the beginning) require moving more data and
 * therefore will be slower. Overall, it is cheapest to perform updates at the
 * end of the list due to minimal lookup cost and zero data movement.
 *
 * TODO: optimization if all list members are of the same size, then we can
 * remove the entry header all together and seeking will be extremely easy.
 *
 * TODO: if it is common to insert data at the beginning (e.g. a FIFO queue),
 * create additional heuristics or switches, similar to the ones used for
 * append/prepend in Twemcache (pelikan-twemcache), to reduce the amount of
 * data that need to be moved during insertion.
 *
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 * =======
 *
 * The following is a ziplist containing the two elements representing
 * the integer 2 and string "pi". It is composed of 15 bytes, that we visually
 * split into sections:
 *
 *  [02 00 00 00] [0e 00 00 00] [03 02] [ff 02 70 69 05]
 *  ╰-----------╯ ╰-----------╯ ╰-----╯ ╰--------------╯
 *        2             14         3          "pi"
 *
 * The first 4 bytes represent the number 2, that is the number of entries
 * the whole ziplist is composed of. The second 4 bytes are the offset
 * at which the end of ziplist entries is found.
 *
 * Next is the body, "03 02" as the first entry representing the number 2. It
 * starts with the byte 0x03 which corresponds to the encoding of the small
 * integer, the 0x02 is the length of the current entry. The next entry, "pi",
 * has an encoding byte of value 0xff (255), and a length of 5 bytes, the
 * content "pi" is stored between these two values, whose hex form is 0x70 0x69.
